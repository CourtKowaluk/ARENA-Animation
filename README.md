# ARENA-Animation
ARENA Animation

This details the process of creating a simple animated 3D model in Blender, and then animating it on a click event in the CONIX ARENA. It uses MQTT as a primary way of initalizing and communicating with the ARENA.

#Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

For this, Blender is used, as it is free and versatile. However, any other 3D modeling & animation software will suffice, as long as the file is exported to a *.glb or *.gltf format.
