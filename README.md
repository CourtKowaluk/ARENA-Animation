# ARENA Animation
This details the process of creating a simple animated 3D model in Blender, and then animating it on a click event in the CONIX ARENA. It uses MQTT as a primary way of initalizing and communicating with the ARENA.

# Getting Started With Modeling
For this, Blender is used, as it is free and versatile. However, any other 3D modeling & animation software will suffice, as long as the file is exported to a *.glb or *.gltf format.
